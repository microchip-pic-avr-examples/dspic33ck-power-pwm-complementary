# dspic33c-power-pwm-complementary, release v1.0.0

### Release Highlights
This is the initial release demonstrating the basic configuration of a high-resolution PWM generator of the dsPIC33C family of devices.
This example is part of a series of code examples highlighting specific operating modes and features.

### Features Added\Updated
In this intial version the on-board LED of the dsPIC33CK Digital Power Plug-In Module is toggled with a interval Ã¼period of 300 ms, when the controller is running at maximum speed of 100 MIPS.
After startup, PWM generator #3 is generating a 200 kHz complementary waveform at the PWM3H/PWM3L outputs. By pressing the on-board push button *USER* on the Digital Power Develpoment Board, the switching frequency is toggled between the initial 200 kHz and 1 MHz.
